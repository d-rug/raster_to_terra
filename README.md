No one wants to relearn something they already know how to do. But
sometimes there's no other choice. The sp, rgdal, rgeos, and maptools
packages will be [gone by the end of
2023](https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html). The raster
package is not long for this world
[either](https://rspatial.org/raster/). sf is nice, but it doesn't have
the necessary raster functionality for many types of analysis. This
workshop aims to make the transition from raster to terra as painless as
possible.

## Learning Goals

-   Get a sense for the functionality of the terra package as a whole
-   Be able to translate existing code from deprecated packages to terra
    syntax
-   Know where to find more information about `terra`.

### Prerequisites

-   Familiarity with `raster` and `sp`

## Resources

-   [Spatial Data with terra on
    rspatial.org](https://rspatial.org/spatial/index.html) - How to do
    spatial data analysis in the context of R and the `terra` package.

-   [terra documentation on
    rspatial.org](https://rspatial.org/pkg/index.html) - A vignette that
    walks you through the `terra` package.

-   [terra documentation on
    github](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/terra-package.html) -
    An overview of `terra` and a comprehensive description of its
    classes and methods. Highlights differences between `raster` and
    `terra`.

-   [geodata documentation on
    github](https://github.com/rspatial/geodata) - A description of
    available data as well as some links to the original source.

The course reader is a live webpage, hosted through GitHub, where you
can enter curriculum content and post it to a public-facing site for
learners.

To make alterations to the reader:

1.  Check in with the reader's current maintainer and notify them about
    your intended changes. Maintainers might ask you to open an issue,
    use pull requests, tag your commits with versions, etc.

2.  Run `git pull`, or if it's your first time contributing, see
    [Setup](#setup).

3.  Edit an existing chapter file or create a new one. Chapter files are
    R Markdown files (`.Rmd`) at the top level of the repo. Enter your
    text, code, and other information directly into the file. Make sure
    your file:

    -   Follows the naming scheme `##_topic-of-chapter.Rmd` (the only
        exception is `index.Rmd`, which contains the reader's front
        page).
    -   Begins with a first-level header (like `# This`). This will be
        the title of your chapter. Subsequent section headers should be
        second-level headers (like `## This`) or below.
    -   Uses caching for resource-intensive code (see
        [Caching](#caching)).

    Put any supporting resources in `data/` or `img/`. For large files,
    see [Large Files](#large-files). You do not need to add resources
    generated by your R code (such as plots). The knit step saves these
    in `docs/` automatically.

4.  Run `knit.R` to regenerate the HTML files in the `docs/`. You can do
    this in the shell with `./knit.R` or in R with `source("knit.R")`.

5.  When you're finished, `git add`:

    -   Any files you added or edited directly, including in `data/` and
        `img/`
    -   `docs/` (all of it)
    -   `_bookdown_files/` (contains the **knitr** cache)

    Then `git commit` and `git push`. The live web page will update
    automatically after 1-10 minutes.
