# Overview {-}

No one wants to relearn something they already know how to do. But sometimes 
there's no other choice. The sp, rgdal, rgeos, and maptools packages will be
[gone by the end of 2023](https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html).
The raster package is not long for this world [either](https://rspatial.org/raster/).
sf is nice, but it doesn't have the raster functionality necessary for many
types of analysis. This workshop aims to make the transition from raster to
terra as painless as possible. 

## Learning Goals

- Get a sense for the functionality of the terra package as a whole
- Be able to translate existing code from deprecated packages to terra syntax
- Know where to find more information about `terra`.

**This presentation will NOT give you a comprehensive discussion of `terra`.**

It is too short for that. However, it will provide links to places you can find 
more documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the raster and sp packages 

## What we will cover

 - read/write
 - transformations
 - joining
 - calculations
 - get coordinates for spatVector
 - sampling
 - transformation
 - Plotting
 - interpolation
 - data access

# `terra`: a bird's eye view

 - The last spatial package you'll ever need*
 - Rasters and Vectors, with united functions where possible
 - One task, one function
 - Improved speed
 - Very large: 345 functions; raster has 277, sf has 150
 - Some things changed, many stayed the same
 
Old Packages: sp, raster, rgdal, rgeos, maptools

New Packages: terra and geodata (for data)


```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(microbenchmark) # for speed testing

#new packages
library(terra) 
library(geodata)

#old packages
library(raster)
library(rgdal)

#table formatting
library(data.table)
library(kableExtra)

options(warn=-1)

elev_fn = system.file("ex/elev.tif", package="terra")
lux_fn = system.file("ex/lux.shp", package="terra")

elev = rast(elev_fn)
r_elev = raster(elev)

lux = vect(lux_fn)
sp_lux = shapefile(lux_fn)

```


```{r table_setup, echo=FALSE}

funs = fread('data/raster_to_terra_funs.csv')

vars = c('Operation', 'DataType', 'old', 'terra')

col_names = c('Operation', 'Data Type', 'Old Functions', 'New Functions')

```


# The basics

## Reading in data

Reading and writing data functionality is based on GDAL, so you will have all 
the flexibility in your choice of file type that GDAL provides. 

```{r io_table, echo=FALSE}

io = funs[OperationGroup=='I/O', ..vars]

io %>% 
  kbl(col.names = col_names) %>% 
  kable_styling()

```




```{r read_raster_bench}

# reading raster data 

microbenchmark(
  rast(elev_fn),
  raster(elev_fn),
  
  times = 100
)



```


```{r read_vect_bench, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

#reading vector data
microbenchmark(
  vect(lux_fn),
  shapefile(lux_fn),
  readOGR(lux_fn),
  
  times=100
)


```

## Writing data

The function `writeRaster()` is relatively unchanged, though the argument 
specifying the type of file written has changed from `format` (in `raster`) to 
`filetype` (in `terra`). Additionally, while in theory the function can 
automatically detect the file type, it seems to rarely work, so it is better to 
just specify `filetype` from the get-go. 

```{r write_raster}

microbenchmark(
  terra::writeRaster(elev,
                     filename='data/elevation.GTiff',
                     filetype='GTiff', 
                     overwrite=TRUE),
  raster::writeRaster(r_elev,
                      filename='data/elevation.GTiff',
                      format='GTiff',
                      overwrite=TRUE),
  
  times = 100
)

```

With `spatVectors` we get `writeVector()`, which largely mirrors `writeRaster()`.

```{r write_vect}

microbenchmark(
  writeVector(lux, 
            filename='data/lux.shp', 
            overwrite=TRUE),
  shapefile(sp_lux, 
            filename='data/lux.shp', 
            overwrite=TRUE),
  
  times = 100
)


```


# Transform

```{r transform_table, echo=FALSE}

trans_tab = funs[OperationGroup=='Transform', ..vars]

trans_tab %>% 
  kbl(col.names = col_names) %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

Most of the methods for transforming spatial data remain the same from raster.
The exception to that is `raster::projectRaster()`, which now becomes 
`terra::project()` and now works for both rasters and vectors. 

```{r project_raster_bench}

microbenchmark(
  terra::project(elev, "epsg:3310"),
  raster::projectRaster(r_elev, crs="epsg:3310"),
  
  times=10
)


```

# Calculate
One of `raster`'s claims to fame was the ease at which you could do calculations.
R automatically treated each cell in a `RasterLayer` as if it was a number, and 
each cell in a `RasterBrick` or `RasterStack` as if it were a vector. There were
additional functions for doing calculations on an entire layer of a raster and 
for applying non-vectorized functions.

```{r calculate_table, echo=FALSE}

calc_tab = funs[OperationGroup=='Calculate', ..vars]

calc_tab %>% 
  kbl(col.names = col_names) %>% 
  kable_styling()

```
